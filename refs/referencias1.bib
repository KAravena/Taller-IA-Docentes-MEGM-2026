Disparities rooted in SES have become more pronounced as social inequities have increased, and parental expectations for academic success have risen. This study aims to elucidate the intricate dynamics that affect student academic success. This study examines the critical role of family SES in contributing to student academic performance and identifies key factors that shape this relationship based on existing literature and research data. The study examines the direct impact of SES on academic performance and the mediating effect of parental educational contributions, demonstrating how parental participation might alleviate the challenges encountered by kids from lower SES families. To address this issue, the government and community can intervene to a certain extent. For educators and legislators to create successful interventions that assist underprivileged kids and advance educational equity, they must have a thorough understanding of these variables.}}

Global test score data is used to estimate learning losses by modeling the effect of school closures on achievement by predicting the deviation of the most recent results from a linear trend using data from all rounds of PISA. Mathematics scores declined an average of 14 percent of a standard deviation, roughly equal to seven months of learning. Losses are greater for students in schools that faced relatively longer closures, for boys, immigrants, and disadvantaged students. Educational losses may translate into significant national income losses over time.}}

Se crearon modelos de análisis multinivel (5 para Matemáticas y 5 para Lectura). Como resultados, se destaca la incidencia de la repitencia y de la posición del estudiante en el Indicador Socioeconómico y de Capital Cultural (ISECC). La discusión considera la complejidad del proceso enseñanza-aprendizaje debido a la diversidad de condiciones socioculturales de los estudiantes, experiencia educativa e individualidad, a pesar de existir referentes colectivos para categorizar a los estudiantes en grupos únicos. Como principales conclusiones se observa la incidencia del ISECC en ambas áreas evaluadas. Se propone para futuras investigaciones indagar el efecto de las variables segmentando poblaciones, según dimensiones de ISECC, otros referentes estratégicos u otras variables de incidencia dentro del aula.}}

A systematic approach to review the published and available documents in online databases. The researcher reaches the point of saturation by browsing 68 published documents. These documents have been selected using the inclusion criteria on gender differentials in academic performance in higher education. The study findings outline that biological differences are less likely to affect the performance of female and male students rather than shaped by cultural differences. Females’ deprivation of education was due to the traditional and cultural practices in male hegemonic society. The study concludes that the difference in educational performance among female and male students in higher education is not linked with biological characteristics. It has roots in the difference of psycho-social, socio-economic, and cultural factors of socialization among female and male students.}}

               participated in the National Educational Study 2018 (Chile),

               8-10 years). Schools were divided into non-PSPA (n = 4,280) and
               PSPA (n = 710) during the year 2018. Changes in academic
               achievement from 2017 to 2018 and school climate were
               considered. PSPA was associated with improvements in maths
               (low-SES OR: 1.80, p < 0.001) and reading (middle-SES OR: 1.45,
               p = 0.029; low-SES OR: 1.47, p < 0.001). The indirect effect
               (IE) showed that PSPA partially mediated the relationship
               between SES and academic achievement in reading (IE = 1.017; SE
               = 0.12; 95\%CI, -1.27, -0.77), maths (IE = -1.019; SE = 0.12;
               95\%CI, -1.25, -0.78), and school climate (IE = -0.46; SE =
               0.52; 95\%CI, -0.56, -0.35). In conclusion, PSPA was linked to
               positive changes in academic achievement, especially among low
               SES, and PSPA presented a potential mediating role in the
               relationship between SES of schools and academic achievement and
               school climate.",

In this study, we instead examine how school composition shapes children’s educational aspirations, given their achievement, and if children from different socio-economic backgrounds are affected differently. We apply school-fixed effects on Swedish register data, including all 9th-grade students from 2013 to 2017. Being exposed to a high share of low-achieving schoolmates increases the likelihood of applying for academics instead of vocational tracking across socio-economic backgrounds. In contrast, the share of high-achieving schoolmates is negatively associated with academic tracking only for high-SES children. Being exposed to peers with highly educated parents increases the likelihood of applying for academic tracking for low-SES children, whereas the effect is weaker or even negative for some of the high-SES groups. Together, our results suggest that the academic decisions of both high- and low-SES children could benefit from a less segregated school environment.},

abstract={Research on education inequalities has long established the relationship between the social composition of schools and achievement levels. However, the empirical study of the social processes in choosing schools and their potential effects on achievement inequalities has often been neglected. This article investigates the extent to which such social processes, related to parentsâ€™ educational preferences and expectations, influence the development of studentsâ€™ achievement throughout their schooling career, as a channel of transmission of social inequality. Using longitudinal census data from Chile, which allows us to observe studentsâ€™ achievements between the 4th and 10th grades, we find support for the claim that the development of achievement inequalities operate partly through well-off parentsâ€™ educational preferences and expectations. Moreover, these preferences and beliefs explain most of the social composition effect of schools on achievement inequalities. We conclude that choice processes should be considered as an integral part of theories aimed to explain achievement inequalities as a dynamic process.},

               Abbreviated Math Anxiety Scale (AMAS) in primary and secondary
               school students (N = 1,504 students, 46.08\% males, 7-19 years
               of age). The results of confirmatory factor analysis
               corroborated the original two-factor structure, although a
               modified two-factor model with one item loading simultaneously
               on both factors was better supported. Full measurement
               invariance was observed across gender, and partial measurement
               invariance was achieved across educational levels (primary and
               secondary education). The AMAS showed reasonable internal
               consistency, test-retest reliability, and convergent validity.
               These results highlight the utility of the AMAS as a measure of
               math anxiety in primary and secondary school students whose
               scores can be compared by gender and educational level.",

  title     = "Big fish in little ponds are less anxious about math: a
               multilevel analysis of school average achievement on math
               anxiety",
  author    = "Ahmed, Wondimu",
  abstract  = "Abstract Math anxiety has significant implications for math
               achievement and math-related career paths. Previous research on
               antecedents of math anxiety primarily focused on individual
               factors, while the role of the contextual effect of school has
               received limited attention. This study sought to address this
               gap by examining the effect of school-average achievement on
               math anxiety while considering the mediating role of math
               self-concept and the moderating role of perceived control. The
               sample consisted of 4,978 fifteen-year-old students from the USA
               (49.3\% Female). The results of the multilevel analysis revealed
               that school-average achievement positively predicted math
               anxiety, even after controlling for individual student
               achievement, SES, and gender. The results also showed that math
               self-concept mediated the relationship between school-average
               achievement and math anxiety. Furthermore, perceived control
               moderated the effect of school-average achievement on math
               anxiety. These findings shed light on the complex dynamics
               between school context, individual factors, and math anxiety.",
